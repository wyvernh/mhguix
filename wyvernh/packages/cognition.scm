     (description
      "Cognition is a fully introspective system designed so that the syntax and hierarchy structure of the
       language is fully public; that is, a file that contains cognition code can alter the way that it is
       being parsed, in real time. Cognition allows for this because the language is completely postfix with
       extremely minimal syntax, and what exists of the syntax can be changed at will. Because the language
       never reads more than it has to, and because the language allows for metaprogramming (talking about
       symbols as if they are data, as well as code), the syntax of the language is made fluid. This allows
       for the advanced manipulation of how the next token is tokenized, and how these tokens are arranged
       into something like the AST without having to explicitly program a rigid syntax.")
